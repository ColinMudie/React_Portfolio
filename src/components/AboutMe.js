            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>My name is Colin Mudie and I recieved my undergraduate degree from Central Michigan University in
            Music Performance. While music is still such a large portion of my life I have decided to look
            towards my other passion to create a career in.
            I started a coding bootcamp through MSU in Nov, 2020 and have found new realizations. My original
            drive was to be able to afford more modular synthesizers (Those aren't cheap!)
            but I am now also driven by the thrill of learning. I love the idea of always having someting to
            learn and with this field, while I have learned so much already,
            I can understand that I will never truly know everything about Full stack Web Development. Thats
            awesome! I'm always going to have my goals moving, will never stagnate, and will always be moving
            forward everyday!
